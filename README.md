# weather-app
This is a weather app created while taking Skillcrush's Ruby on Rails Blueprint.  It was made using a ruby gem called Yahoo Weatherman that uses the Yahoo Weather feed Api.  It will ask you for your zip code and will return the weather forecast for the next 5 days for your area (in Celsius).
